#+TITLE: Simple web application to manage reservation for gala concert

* Introduction

This is a simplistic set of CGI scripts adapted for my web host.

* Deployment

Use the ~deploy.sh~ script like this:
#+begin_src shell :exports code
  ./deploy.sh 'user@host' 'username' 'groupname' 'destination_folder'
#+end_src

- ~user@host~ :: anything that `ssh` accepts.
- ~username~ and ~groupname~ :: CGI scripts are only executed if they belong
  to a specific user/group that does not correspond to the user/group of the
  system where development happens.  These parameters set the user/group in
  the destination.
- ~destination_folder~ :: where to deploy.
